# Heroes-Swift-2015-iOS
XCODE 6.1.1

Let's face it, not everyone can be a hero.

Superdude here is no exception. All he wants to do is fly home and take a nap or maybe a shower. However, some crazy psycho villian is throwing hostages out of a plane! Your job is actually to dodge as many civilians as you can. Don't worry, there are real heroes on the job. Let them take care of it and you just focus on getting home safe. Don't be a hero Superdude.
